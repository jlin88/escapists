# Escapists

The game is based off of the indie game “The Escapists” whose premise is to escape from various prison levels. The specific level will be based off of Cougar Creek Railroad which is a prison on a moving train. The player will need to collect key items and perform actions to escape from the train. This will be a text-based version of the escapists so the user will interact with the game through menus. The player’s health points will represent number of moves they can make. Every time the player moves to a new space, 1 health will be deducted. There will also be a hard item check in the Security car where the player will lose if they do not have the proper items.
